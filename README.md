(Pronunciation: _**/mjuÀêÀàte…™t/**_, 'k' is silent).   
Generates mutable models from immutable model definitions. It's based on Kotlin's Symbol Processor (KSP) which 
generates compile-time safe code. **So you just need to focus on actual development and _Mutekt_ will write boilerplate for you!** üòé   

Navigate to the section _["Why Mutekt?"](#why-mutekt)_ to understand the need and advantages of using Mutekt.

_Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è for Kotliners_. 

## Adding _Mutekt_ to the project

You can check [`/example`](/example) directory which includes example application for demonstration.

### 1. Gradle setup

#### 1.1 Enable KSP in module

In order to support code generation at compile time, [enable KSP support in the module](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-quickstart.html#use-your-own-processor-in-a-project).

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.google.devtools.ksp' version '1.7.10-1.0.6'
}
```

#### 1.2 Add dependencies

In `build.gradle` of app module, include this dependency

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("dev.shreyaspatil.mutekt:mutekt-core:$mutektVersion")
    ksp("dev.shreyaspatil.mutekt:mutekt-codegen:$mutektVersion")
    
    // Include kotlin coroutine to support usage of StateFlow 
    implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.4")
}
```

_You can find the latest version and changelogs in the [releases](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/mutekt/releases)_.

#### 1.3 Include generated classes in sources

> **Warning**   
> In order to make IDE aware of generated code, it's important to include KSP generated sources in the project source sets.

Include generated sources as follows:

<details open>
  <summary><b>Gradle (Groovy)</b></summary>

```groovy
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        main.kotlin.srcDirs += 'build/generated/ksp/main/kotlin'
        test.kotlin.srcDirs += 'build/generated/ksp/test/kotlin'
    }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Gradle (KTS)</b></summary>

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets.main {
        kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/main/kotlin")
    }
    sourceSets.test {
        kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/test/kotlin")
    }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Android (Gradle - Groovy)</b></summary>

```groovy
android {
    applicationVariants.all { variant ->
        kotlin.sourceSets {
            def name = variant.name
            getByName(name) {
                kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/$name/kotlin")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Android (Gradle - KTS)</b></summary>

```kotlin
android {
    applicationVariants.all {
        kotlin.sourceSets {
            getByName(name) {
                kotlin.srcDir("build/generated/ksp/$name/kotlin")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

### 2. Apply annotation

Declare a state model as an `interface` and apply `@GenerateMutableModel` annotation to it.

Example:

```kotlin
@GenerateMutableModel
interface NotesState {
    val isLoading: Boolean
    val notes: List<String>
    val error: String?
}
// You can also apply annotation `@Immutable` if using for Jetpack Compose UI model.
```

> **Note**
> **Checklist for applying annotation**
>- [x] Interface must have ***public*** visibility.
>- [x] All members properties should have ***public*** visibility.


Once done, **üî®Build project** and mutable model will be generated for the immutable definition by KSP.

### 3. Use generated mutable model

Once project is built and models are generated, the mutable model can be created with the factory function: `Mutable__()`.  
_For example, if interface name is `ExampleState` then method name for creating mutable model will be 
`MutableExampleState()` and will have parameters in it which are declared as public properties in the interface._

To get immutable instance with reactive state updates, use method `asStateFlow()` which returns instance of [`StateFlow<>`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-state-flow/).
Whenever any field of Mutable model is updated with new value, this StateFlow gets updated with new immutable state value.

***Refer to the following example for complete usage***

```kotlin
class NotesViewModel: ViewModel() {

    /**
     * Instance of mutable model [MutableNotesState] which is generated with Mutekt.
     */
    private val _state = MutableNotesState(isLoading = false, notes = emptyList(), error = null)

    /**
     * Immutable (read-only) StateFlow of a [NotesState].
     */
    val state: StateFlow<NotesState> = _state.asStateFlow()

    fun loadNotes() {
        _state.isLoading = true

        try {
            _state.notes = getNotes()
        } catch (e: Throwable) {
            _state.error = e.message ?: "Error occurred"
        }
        _state.isLoading = false
    }
}
```

In this example, only ViewModel is allowed to mutate the state i.e. manage the state for UI. `StateFlow<NotesState>` is 
exposed to the UI layer which means UI won't be able to ***directly*** manipulate the state.

## Why Mutekt?

Let's understand the reason for which Mutekt came to picture.

Taking inspiration from Redux's way of state management having immutable state model in Kotlin ecosystem, implementation
in Kotlin needs a lot of care and boilerplate to properly handle the state.

### Without Mutekt

Assume this is UI state model:

```kotlin
data class NotesState(val isLoading: Boolean, val notes: List<String>, val error: String?)
```

Here are well known popular opinionated approaches in the Kotlin community:

#### 1. Copying State model

In this approach, a mutable state flow is created with initial state. Whenever state needs to be mutated, previous
state is used to calculate next state i.e. it just copies the previous state.

```kotlin
class NotesViewModel: ViewModel() {
    private val _state = MutableStateFlow(NotesState(false, emptyList(), null))
    val state = _state.asStateFlow()
    
    fun loadNotes() {
        _state.update { it.copy(isLoading = true) }
        
        val notes = getNotes()
        _state.update { it.copy(notes = notes, isLoading = false) }
    }
}
```

In this approach, following things needs to be taken care of:
- The new state should be updated atomically and with synchronization otherwise state inconsistency will occur
  (_i.e. `update{}` method of StateFlow_).
- By dev mistake, while updating new state if previous state is not copied (by `it.copy()`) the previous state will
  be lost.

#### 2. Combining multiple states to form new one

```kotlin
class NotesViewModel: ViewModel() {
    private val isLoading = MutableStateFlow(false)
    private val notes = MutableStateFlow(emptyList<String>())
    private val error = MutableStateFlow<String?>(null)
    
    val state: StateFlow<NotesState> = combine(isLoading, notes, error) { isLoading, notes, error ->
        NotesState(isLoading, notes, error)
    }.stateIn(viewModelScope, WhileSubscribed(), NotesState(false, emptyList(), null))
    
    fun loadNotes() {
        isLoading.value = true
        
        notes.value = getNotes()
        isLoading.value = false
    }
}
```

In this approach, there's no scope for mistakes but needs repeated boilerplate for each property of state model.
As new state property is added in the codebase while development, refactoring is needed everytime to have proper state
management.

### With Mutekt

_Mutekt solves the issues around the above-mentioned approaches and lets developer focus on the state manipulation
instead of declaring each and every state field every time by generates required and common boilerplate at compile time
by annotation processing._

With Mutekt you just need to declare state model as interface and apply the annotation. Rest magic is done by the KSP.

```kotlin
@GenerateMutableModel
interface NotesState {
    val isLoading: Boolean
    val notes: List<String>
    val error: String?
}

class NotesViewModel: ViewModel() {
    private val _state = MutableNotesState(isLoading = false, notes = emptyList(), error = null)
    val state = _state.asStateFlow()
    
    fun loadNotes() {
        _state.isLoading = true
        val fetchedNotes = getNotes()
        _state.apply {
            isLoading = false
            notes = fetchedNotes
        }
    }
}
```
